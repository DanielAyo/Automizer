# Automizer
A Real Time System for Backing Vocal Harmonization

This project was concerned with the design and execution of a real time system whereby the harmonic information of a polyphonic instrument is directly applied to another monophonic instrument, specifically the human voice. 

The intention was to develop an algorithm capable of synthesizing harmonies in real time from a vocal melody with respect to the detected chords generated by an accompanying instrument. 

The algorithm in its current form optimizes existing methods for pitch and chord detection and is able to sufficiently detect the pitch of a human voice and the chord of an accompanying instrument in real time. 

Please review the user manual for instructions on how to use the VST in your perferred DAW.


TODO: 
- Add MIDI functionality
- Add waveform visuals
- Implement side chain support for VST3
